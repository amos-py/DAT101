      <li>Where should you use constants, and where should you use variables? Can they all be constants?</li>
      <p>
				Constants and variables are not identical as they both have their own use case. A constant should only be used for “fixed” values (things that will never change). Think pi.
        Variables on the other hand are for values that we expect will update in the future. A great example of this is a health system in a video game, when you take damage or heal. 
        The health will in-/ or decrease in value. Using a constant here would make changing this value impossible, as it is a constant.   
			</p>
      <li>How do parentheses affect the arithmetic outcome of an expression?</li>
      <p>
				Values in parentheses will always be calculated first, which can alter the end result. 
			</p>
      <li>How do we limit floating-point numbers to a given number of decimals?</li>
      <p>
				To limit floating-point numbers to a given number of decimals we can use toFIxed(). 
			</p>
      <li>How can we compare two floating-point values to see if they are equal (is 12.199999 the same as 12.2)?</li>
      <p>
				Using "==". Pseudocode: if (12.199999 == 12.2) print("Equal") else print("Not Equal")
			</p>
      <li>What do comparison operators return, and how can we check if they are FALSE or TRUE?</li>
      <p>
				Comparison operators return a boolean value: either TRUE or FALSE. We can use an if-statement for this.
			</p>
      <li>How does the Math.random() function work, and what can it be used for?</li>
      <p>
				Math.random() returns a float number up to 1.0. It is "pseudo-random", meaning it is not truly random. If you want a number higher than 1.0, you can multiply it by i.e. 10. It's useful for making dice rolls and other random values.
			</p>
      <li>What is modulus (%), and when do we need this operator in mathematical operations?</li>
      <p>
				Modulus checks the remaining value after a division. It is useful for checking if a number is even or odd.
