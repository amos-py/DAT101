      <li>[In part 1, is it possible to solve the problem using a single "for" loop?]</li>
      <p>Using the index for the loop as a variable, then either adding or subtracting to two other variables. Though the task asks to only use two lines. This would probably take more.</p>
      </br>
      
      <li>[In part 2, can we create what is known as an "infinite" loop within the condition of the "while" loop?
          Describe what would or would not be necessary to achieve this. Provide a thorough explanation of
          your answer]</li>
      <p>An infinite loop is simply a loop that doesn't have a reason to stop. We stop the loop in Task 2 when we find the answer, or hidden number. If this was a number outside of the random number generator, it would never find it - and therefore never stop.</p>
      </br>

      <li>[Discuss briefly how quickly or slowly a computer might be able to compute this, considering the
          number of guesses and the time it takes. How does the program behave while it is guessing? Can
          the program perform other tasks concurrently?]</li>
      <p>In a way, I guess. Computer code always runs line-by-line, which if we have another line of code within the loop, it would take a guess, then execute the other line of code, then repeat until the condition is met. This happens at an extremely fast rate, so it takes literall milliseconds to compute.</p>
      </br>

      <li>[Explain the relationship between rows and columns in nested "for" loops. Can we, for instance,
          change the order, considering rows to be innermost or columns to be innermost, or does this not
          matter?]</li>
      <p>Yes we can change the order, but we define both the numbers and characters for the rows and collums, so it doesn't really matter.</p>
