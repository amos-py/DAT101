    <ol>
      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 1, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>When the wake up time is not 7, the first if-statement will execute the printOut function and write "I can take the bus to school."</p>

      <li>Same as question #1. How ever the answer should now be different. Discuss the behavior of part 2, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>When it is exactly 7: I can take the bus to school - when it is not 7: I can take the train to school. </p>

      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 3, what happens when wake time is less than 7 or greater than 8?</li>
      <p>Less than 7: I can take the bus to school. Greater than 8: I have to take the car to school.</p>

      <li>Discuss the behavior for part 4, what happens if the number is exactly 0, is zero positive or negative?</li>
      <p>Zero is a neutral integer, which will not respond to neither <= -1 nor >= 1. An else if which specifies 0 is therefore needed. </p>
